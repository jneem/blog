Hello.

My name is Joe.

I work in a SimpleButtonFactoryAwareAspectInstanceFactory.

Ok, not really, but I do write software for a living. Once in a
great while, I also write *about* software. If that's what you're here
for, check out my [blog](@/posts/_index.md).

In a previous career, I published papers on probability, geometry and
computer science. Those papers are all available on the
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/neeman_j_1.html), and there's also a
summary of some of my research themes [here](@/math/_index.md).
